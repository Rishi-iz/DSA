# **# Intuition**

<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->

- The array is already sorted.
- That means all duplicates will be grouped together.
- So if we scan the array from left to right:
- Whenever we see a new number different from the previous one, thatâ€™s a unique element.
- We just need to keep track of where the next unique element should go.

**# ðŸ‘‰ Using two pointers:**

One pointer (i) keeps track of the position of the last unique element.

Another pointer (j) scans through the array.

Each time we find a new unique number, we "extend" the unique section by writing it at nums[i+1].

This way:

All unique elements are moved to the front.

Duplicates are skipped automatically.

No extra space is needed.

# **# Approach**

<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->

**# Two Pointers**

Idea:

Since the array is already sorted, duplicates will always be adjacent.

We maintain two pointers:

i â†’ the index of the last unique element found so far.

j â†’ the index scanning through the array.

Steps:

Start with i = 0.

Iterate j from 1 to n-1.

If nums[j] != nums[i] â†’ we found a new unique element:

Increment i.

Place this unique element at nums[i] = nums[j].

Otherwise, if they are equal â†’ skip it (since itâ€™s a duplicate).

Return:

After the loop ends, the number of unique elements is i + 1.

The first i+1 elements of nums are unique and sorted.

- CONFUSED in the index marking , comparing and replacing the elements

### 3. **What can I do next time to make sure I don't make the same mistakes again?**

## DRY RUN

Weâ€™ll use this example:

```
nums = [1,1,2,2,3]

```

### Initial setup

- `i = 0`Â (last unique element position)
- `j = 1`Â (scanning pointer)
- Array =Â `[1,1,2,2,3]`

---

### Step 1 â†’Â `j = 1`

- CompareÂ `nums[i] = nums[0] = 1`Â withÂ `nums[j] = nums[1] = 1`
- They are equal â†’ duplicate â†’ skip
- `i = 0`
- Array unchanged:Â `[1,1,2,2,3]`

---

### Step 2 â†’Â `j = 2`

- CompareÂ `nums[i] = nums[0] = 1`Â withÂ `nums[j] = nums[2] = 2`
- Different â†’ found new unique element
- IncrementÂ `i = 1`
- CopyÂ `nums[j]`Â toÂ `nums[i]`Â â†’Â `nums[1] = 2`
- Array becomes:Â `[1,2,2,2,3]`

---

### Step 3 â†’Â `j = 3`

- CompareÂ `nums[i] = nums[1] = 2`Â withÂ `nums[j] = nums[3] = 2`
- They are equal â†’ duplicate â†’ skip
- `i = 1`
- Array unchanged:Â `[1,2,2,2,3]`

---

### Step 4 â†’Â `j = 4`

- CompareÂ `nums[i] = nums[1] = 2`Â withÂ `nums[j] = nums[4] = 3`
- Different â†’ found new unique element
- IncrementÂ `i = 2`
- CopyÂ `nums[j]`Â toÂ `nums[i]`Â â†’Â `nums[2] = 3`
- Array becomes:Â `[1,2,3,2,3]`

---

### End of loop

- FinalÂ `i = 2`
- Answer =Â `i + 1 = 3`Â (number of unique elements)

---

âœ… Result:

- Unique portion of array =Â `[1,2,3]`
- Return value =Â `3`
